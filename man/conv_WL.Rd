\title{conv_WL: converts cm of water above the logger to water level relative to surface}
\usage{
conv_WL(df, site_code, ground, corfac)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data frame with pressure data}

\item{site_code}{Quoted code for site name that corresponds to a field in the data frame}

\item{ground}{numeric distance between the logger and the surface of the wetland
(Logger Length + Measuring Point to Bold - Stick Up Height).}

\item{corfac}{numeric correction factor (in cm) to correct for difference in atmospheric pressure
due to differing elevations between where the water level loggers are and where the
atmospheric pressure loggers are.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with a new column labeled with SITECODE_WL, which is the water level
in cm relative to the surface of the wetland. Negative values are below ground, positive are above ground.
}
\description{
This function converts cm of water above the logger to water level relative
to the surface of the weltand. For this function to work, you must have a field named: SITECODE_cm.
To get this field, should either run the conv_kpa_cm() function first, or calculate cm of water
for that site by hand. The SITECODE also needs to be defined in the function arguments.

\examples{
df <- data.frame(time = c('t1', 't2', 't3'), BIGH_cm = c(92, 93.4, 96.5))
df2 <- conv_WL(df, site_code = 'BIGH', ground = 88.9, cor = 5.004)
