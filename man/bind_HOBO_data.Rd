\title{bind_HOBO_data: Binds raw HOBO well data from csv}
\usage{
bind_HOBO_data(
  path = NA,
  export = TRUE,
  site_codes = c("BIGH", "DUCK", "GILM", "HEBR", "HODG", "LIHU", "NEMI", "WMTN"),
  well_id = c(11, 9, 12, 15, 16, 13, 14, 10)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Quoted path of the folder where the exported Hobo csvs for a single visit are located.}

\item{export}{/code{TRUE} or /code{FALSE}. If TRUE (Default), exports final csv file to specified path.}

\item{site_codes}{Quoted string of 4-letter site codes which are assumed to be in the file names
of the water level csvs to be imported. If importing all 8 sentinel sites without changes, default
settings do not need to be changed. If sites differ from default settings, in length or name, then both
site_codes and well_id must be specified and match in length. Function only accepts one file per site code
in specified path.}

\item{well_id}{Numbered list of Well_ID matching tbl_Well in MS Access RAM database. If importing
all 8 sentinel sites without changes, default settings do not need to be changed. This is the primary
key used to link water level data to well visit data tables. The well_id should match the Well_ID record
from the tbl_Wells for a given site in the MS Access RAM backend.}
}
\value{
Returns a long data frame of raw water level data.
}
\description{
This function imports individual raw HOBO well data files that were exported
as csvs in the HOBOconnect iOS app. Spring (October to April data) visit files should be in a
separate folder from fall visit files, each site should have its own csv, and each site's file
name should contain its 4-letter code (e.g. Duck Pond Peatland's code is DUCK) as specified
in the site_codes argument. The individual site data are row bound to match the raw water
level table that matches tbl_Water_Level in the MS Access RAM backend.

This function generates a long format of the raw water level data to append to the existing water
level table. By default, this function imports all 8 sentinel sites by their site code. Changing site_codes
and well_id allows you to import differing number and names of sites. Note that each imported file
must contain the following columns: # (Index column), Date-Time (EDT/EST),
Differential Pressure (kPa), Absolute Pressure (kPa), Temperature (C), Water Level (m),
Barometric Pressure (kPa). If the hard coding of column names causes difficulty, will revise
function to be more generic in future.

Note that this function has been updated to work with data collected by MX2001 water level loggers
with built-in atmospheric pressure correction. Use package version 0.1.5 to compile water
level for HOBO U20 Loggers with external atmospheric pressure correction.
